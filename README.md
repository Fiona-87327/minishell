# minishell

## Description

`minishell` is a simplified Unix shell built for educational purposes as part of the 42 curriculum. Its goal is to help students understand the fundamentals of command-line interpreters, process management, parsing, and I/O redirection. The project aims to replicate the core behavior of a shell, accepting user commands, executing them, handling errors, and managing environment variables.
